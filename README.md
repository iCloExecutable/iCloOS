# iCloOS-master
The new iCloOS built from the remains of the old 1.1.0
# Why you should not build from the master
Because when u compile the master you get 1.1.0 not 1.1.3
# When we will release 1.1.4
We started on 1.1.4. It will be released in a few months. Now you can download RC2 from [here](https://github.com/iCloExecutable/icloos-master/releases/download/beta2/iClosOS.exe)
